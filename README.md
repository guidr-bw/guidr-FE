# GUIDR

Guidr is a mobile first web application created for outdoor enthusiasts to document and share photos and entries of their outdoor adventures  

## My Role
I was the Front-End Developer for this project, I had the responsibility of communicating with a Back-End Developer and a UX Designer to create a product we would all be happy with

## Project Difficulties
At the time I was quite new to Redux and didn't have a lot of confidence in my ability to interact with a RESTful api

## My Solution
I referenced a lot of docs plus dug through several previous projects. I also heavily communicated with our Back-End dev to figure out what data was being sent and recieved

## Notable Features
* Able to create new users and login
* Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete trips
* Ability to add photos
